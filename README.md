The motivation of the project is to develop a tool that can be used to identify the types of
devices (such as mobile and desktop) and also tell which vendor has manufactured the device
used in communication.
This tool has been built to analyze the raw traffic files from Wireshark by scrapping out the
useful information such as User-Agent and MAC addresses of the communicating devices from
the pcap files and mapping them to their corresponding vendors and device types.
